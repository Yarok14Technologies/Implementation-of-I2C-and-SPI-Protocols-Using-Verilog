# Implementation-of-I-C-and-SPI-Protocols-Using-Verilog
This project focuses on the design and implementation of I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocols using Verilog HDL. The objective is to develop synthesizable RTL modules that accurately follow protocol specifications and can be integrated into SoC or FPGA-based designs.
